// It contains all the queries I will be practicing .

1. How many users are active ?

Solution :

[
  {
    $match: {
      isActive : true
    }
  },
  {
    $count: 'activeUsers'
  }
]

2. What is the average age of all users ?

Solution : (Use $group whenever you need to summarize, calculate, or combine data across multiple documents — rather than look at each document individually.)

[
	{
	  $group: {
	    _id: null, // null bcz we want all users
	    average: {
	      $avg: "$age" 
	    }
	  }
	} 
]

3. List the top 5 most common favourite fruits among the users .

Solution : (3 aggregation pipelines used)
    1. To filter the users based on favoriteFruit
    2. Sorting the users based on favoriteFruit
    3. Find the top 'k' based on above pipelines

[
  {
    $group: {
    _id: "$favoriteFruit", // here $favoriteFruit is the group key 
    count:{     // here count is the field , sum is accumulator 
      $sum:1    // increases value by one everytime the favoriteFruit is found
    }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      count: -1 // -1 for descending order , 1 for ascending
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 3 // when we want to find top 3 
  }
]

4. Find the total number of males and females. (I have sorted them as well)

Solution : 

[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$gender",
      Count: {
        $sum: 1
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      Count: 1
    }
  }
]

5. Which country has the highest number of registered user ?

Solution : Used three aggregation pipelines 
(company is an object then used '.' operator , then sort them , then found the highest)

[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$company.location.country",
      count: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
	{
	  $sort: {
	    count: -1 // for highest
	  }
	},
  {
    $limit: 1
  }
]

6. List all the eye colors present in the collection .(then sorted them as well in descending order)

Solution :

[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$eyeColor",
      count: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
	{
	  $sort: {
	    count: -1
	  }
	}
]

7. What is the average number of tags per user ?

Approach 1:

Pipeline:1 - (unwind means : This deconstructs the tags array, creating a new document for each tag.)
Pipeline:2 - First $group : Regroups by _id, counting how many tags each document had (using $sum: 1).
Pipeline:3 - Second $group : Calculates the average of numberOfTags across all documents.

[
  {
    $unwind: {
      path: "$tags",
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$_id",
      numberOfTags:{
        $sum:1
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      avgNumberOfTags: {
        $avg: "$numberOfTags"
      }
    }
  }
]

Approach 2:

Pipeline:1 - $addFields : Adds a field numberOfTags that equals: The size of the tags array, or 0 if tags is missing or null.

Pipeline:2 - $group : Averages the numberOfTags across all documents.

[
  {
    $addFields: {
      numberOfTags: {
        $size:{
          $ifNull:["$tags",[]]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      avgTags: {
        $avg: "$numberOfTags"
      }
    }
  }
]

Conclusion :

    Use $unwind ➜ when you want the average only among docs that have at least one tag.
    Use $size + $ifNull ➜ when you want the average across all docs, treating missing tags as 0.


8 : How many users have 'enim' as one of their tags ?

Solution :

Pipeline:1 - This stage filters documents where tags contains the value "enim".
  If tags is an array, MongoDB automatically matches documents that contain "enim" as one of the elements.

Pipeline:2 - 
  Counts the number of documents that passed through $match.
  The output will be a single document with one field.

[
  {
    $match: {
      tags:"enim"
    }
  },
  {
    $count: 'UserWithEnimTag'
  }
]

9 : What are the names and age of the users who are inactive and have 'velit' as a tag ?

Solution :
